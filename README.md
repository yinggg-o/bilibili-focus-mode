## Words

I want to dedicate this app, as small as it may be, to Michael Jackson, a marvelous human being who is so charismatic that I found myself binge-watching his videos on Bilibili forgetting about everything else, leading to a week where I ended up doing nothing. I had to write a script to prevent myself from doing this agin. Hee Hee
